# Karna
Karna is a web3 project inspired by the character Karna from the Hindu mythological epic, Mahabharata. Just like the virtuous and charitable nature of Karna, this project aims to empower humanitarian efforts through the use of blockchain technology.

## Introduction
Karna is a decentralized platform that enables users from all over the world to contribute to charitable causes and participate in impactful campaigns. By leveraging smart contracts on the blockchain, Karna ensures transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the donation process.

The project revolves around a main smart contract that allows users to donate CCD to the platform. 1% percentage of these donations is allocated to a DAO-managed wallet, which drives the project by supporting volunteer recognition, hosting events, and more.

Volunteers can register with the Karna project by donating $10 to the main smart contract. In return, they receive a unique Volunteer NFT (Non-Fungible Token) that is transferred to their Concordium Identity Wallet. These NFTs represent their commitment to charitable work.

Volunteers can propose new campaigns for the DAO to vote and approve. The campaign proposals include details such as the campaign name, required amount, and deadline to collect the funds. Once a proposal is approved by the DAO, a corresponding campaign smart contract is initialized with the proposed settings, and a portion of the funds from the main smart contract is donated to the campaign.

The campaign smart contract allows users to donate specifically to the campaign, ensuring that the funds are dedicated solely to the approved cause. Volunteers who actively participate in campaigns can claim funds from the campaign smart contract, subject to certain restrictions.

To ensure the authenticity of fund usage, volunteers can upload documents or videos of the social activities they perform with the claimed funds. An AI engine evaluates these submissions, ranking up volunteers and upgrading their NFTs based on their genuine efforts. As volunteers accumulate NFTs, they eventually become DAO members, gaining voting rights for proposals and shaping the future of the platform.

## How It Works
1. Users can visit the Karna platform and connect their Concordium Identity Wallet.
2. The home page allows users to donate CCD to the main smart contract, with 1% automatically allocated to the DAO-managed wallet.
3. Volunteers can register by donating $10 to the main smart contract and receive a Volunteer NFT in return.
4. Volunteers can create campaign proposals with details such as the campaign name, required funds, and deadline.
5. The DAO votes on the proposals, and if approved, a campaign smart contract is initialized, and funds are transferred.
6. Users can donate specifically to approved campaigns, ensuring dedicated funds for each cause.
7. Volunteers who participate in campaigns can claim funds from the campaign smart contract, subject to restrictions.
8. Volunteers can upload documents or videos showcasing their social activities with the claimed funds.
9. An AI engine evaluates the submissions, upgrading the volunteers' NFTs based on their genuine efforts.
10. With accumulated NFTs, volunteers become DAO members with voting rights for proposals and platform governance.
