# 1. Introduction:

Karna is a decentralized platform that aims to revolutionize the way charitable causes are supported and humanitarian efforts are carried out globally. The platform leverages smart contracts on the blockchain to ensure transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the donation process. Karna empowers users from all over the world to contribute to impactful campaigns, and through the use of innovative features like NFTs and DAO governance, it encourages active volunteer participation.

# 2. Project Overview:

Karna's main smart contract allows users to donate CCD (Concordium tokens) to the platform. 1% of these donations is allocated to a DAO-managed wallet, which drives the project by supporting volunteer recognition, hosting events, and facilitating platform development.

Volunteers can register with the Karna project by donating $10 worth of CCD to the main smart contract. In return, they receive a unique Volunteer NFT (Non-Fungible Token) that is transferred to their Concordium Identity Wallet. These NFTs symbolize their commitment to charitable work and their status as valued participants in the Karna ecosystem.

Volunteers can propose new campaigns to the DAO for voting and approval. Campaign proposals include details such as the campaign name, required amount, and deadline to collect the funds. Once a proposal is approved by the DAO, a corresponding campaign smart contract is initialized with the proposed settings, and a portion of the funds from the main smart contract is allocated to the campaign.

The campaign smart contract allows users to donate specifically to the approved campaign, ensuring that the funds are dedicated solely to the cause. Volunteers who actively participate in campaigns can claim funds from the campaign smart contract, subject to certain restrictions.

To ensure the authenticity of fund usage, volunteers can upload documents or videos of the social activities they perform with the claimed funds. An AI engine evaluates these submissions, ranking up volunteers and upgrading their NFTs based on their genuine efforts. As volunteers accumulate NFTs, they eventually become DAO members, gaining voting rights for proposals and shaping the future of the platform.
